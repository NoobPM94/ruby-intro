#puts favorite_foods.inspect

#numbers = [4,2,3,52,2,4]
#puts numbers.inspect

#mixed_array = ["tacos" , 12, true, false, 0.34]

#puts mixed_array


# Accessing the array

#puts favorite_foods[0]

# Add to the array

favorite_foods.push("more tacos")

puts favorite_foods.inspect
puts favorite_foods.count
